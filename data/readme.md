# Getting Access to the Sleep Heart Health Study Dataset

In order to run the workshop, students and instructors will need to request access to the Sleep Heart Health Study data through http://sleepdata.org. In this folder, we've attached a data use agreement and request form.

Timeline: *Two weeks* before the workshop is conducted, everyone should request access to the data.
