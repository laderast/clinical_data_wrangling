Please email Ted (laderast@ohsu.edu) if you have any problems installing R.  

# Getting Started

1. Download the latest R Binary from https://cran.r-project.org and install it by double clicking on the file. Here's the links for each of the different operating systems.

- [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)
- [Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

For Windows users: IMPORTANT! Don't install R under `C:/Program Files/` as it will cause you a lot of issues with installing R packages because of the space in `Program Files`. Instead, create a directory called `R` in your base C: directory and install R there.

2. Download the free version (Open Source License) of RStudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and install it. 

3. Open up RStudio. I recommend watching an introduction to the different parts of the RStudio user interface, here's a link: https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/3-rstudiobasics.html). In the console window, paste the following commands:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("laderast/burro")
install.packages(pkgs = c("caret", "plotly"), 
                 dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports"))
```

## Testing your Install Out

4. Try running the following commands in the console. If you get a window that pops up, you are ready for the workshop!

```
library(burro)
library(ggplot2)
burro::explore_data(diamonds[1:500,])
```
