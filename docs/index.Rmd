The following is the site for the materials for the clinical data wrangling workshop that was held from September 21 to September 26, 2018. This was a 12 hour workshop (spread over 4 days) where students got to work with a real research dataset (the [Sleep Heart Health Study](http://sleepdata.org) data). This is a workshop that we developed as part of an National Library of Medicine T15 training supplement in Data Science. The following is a short report describing the workshop and its outcomes.

## Intended Audience

We designed the workshop for our incoming informatics students (both on the clinical and biological majors) in order to introduce them to the difficulties of working with clinical data.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the biology of sleep and sleep apnea and how the biology informs the covariates measured in the Sleep Heart Health Study
2. Understand why clinical data is useful and also why it's difficult to work with
3. Learn Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and use them to inform model building.
4. Learn to assess logistic regression models using simple diagnostics.

## The Dataset

We used the [Sleep Heart Health Study](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs) dataset from the [National Sleep Research Resource](https://sleepdata.org). This is a dataset of approximately 5800 patients that have over 3000 covariates. We limited our students to a smaller number of covariates (17), including our outcome of interest, cardiovascular disease.

## Workshop Format

We designed the workshop to be a mix of didactic lectures and active learning exercises. Where possible, we had students work in groups to answer questions about the data. These activities included a data scavenger hunt using our EDA exploration app, and a logistic modeling exercise.

### Day 1 Outline

1. Introduction, logistics, and groups assigned (30 minutes)
1. Biology of Sleep and Cardiovascular Disease (40 minutes, format: in-person lecture)
1. Break Time (15 minutes)
1. The Value of Clinical Data (15 minutes, in-person lecture)
1. Clinical Data Quality (40 minutes, in-person lecture)
1. Lunch (90 minutes, with optional R setup session)
1. Exploring the SHHS Dataset (60 minutes, format: Data Scavenger Hunt w/ Shiny App, each team gets a task and has to show the class how to find the information)
1. Applying the Clinical Wrangling Process: Diabetes (45 minutes, format: in-person lecture)
1. Logistic Regression Model Basics (60 minutes, format: walkthrough of R Notebook)

### Day 2

1. Question/Answer session about Logistic Regression and Modeling (50 minutes)
1. Assignment about `race` variable (assigned to groups, take-home assignment)

### Day 3

1. Discussion about `race` as a covariate, sharing of findings
1. Overview of hypertension and how it relates to cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea
1. Template/R Notebook given for final presentation in groups (in-class lab time, template is structured as a series of decisions.)

### Day 4

1. Group presentations about covariate decisions and resulting model (1 hour, present final version of R notebook). At each decision stage, teams must decide on whether or not to include covariates or not given what they have found from exploring the data and justify their decision using EDA visualizations.

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful for the incoming informatics studentsâ€™ enthusiasm and patience. Also thanks to the NLM T15 Supplement in Data Science, without which we would not have gotten the opportunity to conceptualize, put together, and deliver this workshop. Thanks again to Susan Redline and the [National Sleep Research Resource](http://sleepdata.org) group, especially Dan Mobley who helped us with the last-minute data use agreements.
