Please email Ted (laderast@ohsu.edu) if you have any problems installing R.  

# Getting Started

1. Download the latest R Binary from https://cran.r-project.org and install it by double clicking on the file. Here's the links for each of the different operating systems.

- [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)
- [Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)

For Windows users: IMPORTANT! Don't install R under `C:/Program Files/` as it will cause you a lot of issues with installing R packages because of the space in `Program Files`. Instead, create a directory called `R` in your base C: directory and install R there.

1. Download the free version (Open Source License) of RStudio Desktop from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and install it. 

1. Open up RStudio (If you'd like an introduction to the different parts of the RStudio user interface, here's a link: https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/3-rstudiobasics.html). In the console window, paste the following commands:

```
install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "visdat", "ggplot2", 
"naniar", "data.table", "devtools", "DT", "shinydashboard"), dependencies=TRUE)

install.packages(pkgs = "caret", 
                 dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports"))

devtools::install_github("ropensci/skimr")
```

1. Download the project workspace here: https://ohsu.box.com/s/5xjqasu02nzgjsflzjwvmrqvo4aa9ikx. If you have a zip file, make sure to expand the folder rather than just double clicking on it. 

## Testing your Install Out

1. Click on the `shhs_workshop.rproj` file. Make sure you can see the contents of the directory in the `files` tab on the lower right.

1. Try running the following commands in the console. If you get a window that pops up, you are ready for the workshop!

```
library(shiny)
runApp()
```
